This folder is currently there for testing some parts of the project but the main wrapper to fully build dialogs on the terminal is still missing. Therefore this is only a temporary solution until the project has grown enough that the `dialogs` folder contains example dialog fields which will simultaneously be the testing scripts for testing the form parts.
